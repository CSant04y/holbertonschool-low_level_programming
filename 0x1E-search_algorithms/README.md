## What is a search algorithm
* A search algorithm is a combination of a few more algorithms that help retrieve information from a data structure.
* Space complexity of an algorithm is the total space taken by the algorithm in respect to the input size. Auxiliary space on the other hand is the temporary space used up by an algorithm. Space complexity includes both the auxiliary space as well as the space taken up by the algorithm.
## What is a linear search
* A linear search algorithm is one that starts at the most left value. Usually a data structure  such as an array. I then iterates through the array until it finds a match through comparisons of the array.

## What is a binary search
I Binary search is similar to a linear search as they are both traversing an array, however searching through an array linearly is slow and not the most efficient way to preform a search. To do a binary search the array must be split in half each time through recursion. This allows for a a quicker search of an element in an array.
## What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs
A binary search is a search algorithm that calls for efficiency, however, it needs to a sorted array for it to properly work. This  juxtaposes with linear search as the element list does not have to be sorted.
